        "Hospitals designated to provide definitive ICU care must maintain staff and facility readiness through ongoing training and pursuit of best practices.",
        "Health checks and vaccinations in secondary and primary HCF and provision of protective measures in primary health care centers were found to be deficient.Following national regulations, all secondary and tertiary hospitals formulated an internal plan for health care waste management and organized a health care waste management team involving related professionals such as hospital directors, infection control officers, directors of departments and wards, senior nurses, and medical technicians.",

        "The current nursing shortage is related to an aging workforce, problems with retaining licensed personnel, and difficulty recruiting young people into the nursing workforce.",
        "Parallel to this issue is the provision of liability insurance or immunity to rescuers mobilized to a disaster to provide care.Mass casualty events typically receive unsolicited responses from volunteer medical personnel or agencies.",

        "Utilising this mode of ventilation the patient avoided ECMO and made a full recovery with a viable pregnancy.Airway pressure release ventilation was used as opposed to other ventilatory modes or early ECMO because this lung protective ventilation strategy utilised a pressure controlled mode of ventilation.",
        "Extrapolation to EMCC would require pharmacologically paralyzed patients who remain matched for minute ventilation requirements, dynamic airflow resistance, and compliance throughout the duration of ventilation; however, these parameters are likely to vary during the duration of mechanical ventilation, and may even change over a period of minutes (eg, secretions causing increased airflow obstruction).",

        "In particular, all aspects of a disease or of the epidemiology of the infection will require special attention: clinical manifestation (case definition and pathogenesis of influenza), virulence, mode of transmission, incubation period, period of transmissibility, and its effect on the population (distribution and frequency of the disease).",
        "These, however, are likely underestimates of the true burden of vRTIs as unrecognized infection may lead to other complications such as respiratory, cardiovascular or neurological, hospitalizations, and deaths [1, 3, 4] .As the clinical presentation of vRTIs can be similar, laboratory confirmation is important to determine the pathogen responsible for infection.",
        "(10, 11) Given that hypoxia and electrolyte abnormalities that are common in the acute phase of severe illness can potentiate cardiac arrhythmias, the exact arrhythmic risk related to COVID-19 in patients with less severe illness or those who recover from the acute phase of the severe illness is currently unknown.",

        "These background factors might differ depending on features of the infectious disease, including the mode of transmission (for example, contactbased, respiratory, food-borne or vector-borne), the extent of asymptomatic infection or carriage, and the duration of infection.",
        "However, comorbidities are extremely common in severe cases of MERS-CoV, and documentation of timing of occurrences in the literature is unclear.",
        "Host immune responses, underlying comorbidity, age, and the properties of the infecting pathogen can all contribute to severity.The clinical presentation of many infections, such as infl uenza, is not specifi c, which makes diff erential diagnosis and early treatment to reduce further transmission and severe outcomes diffi cult.",
        "A standard approach of early recognition and isolation of FRI followed by early and aggressive diagnostic testing, treatment, and public health involvement is necessary to protect HCWs, patients, and the community from known and unknown emerging infectious diseases.Unfortunately, the exact etiology for FRI with respiratory failure leading to ARDS is unknown at the time of admission to the ICU."

        "We suggest health agencies at all levels of government (ie, Local, Regional, State/Province, and National) and relevant health-care system entities (eg, hospitals, long-term care facilities, and clinics) develop mass critical care (MCC) response plans in furtherance of a legal duty to prepare for mass critical care emergencies.",
        "As with BC, the ON Public Health Standards identify a number of supports for public health capacity building including 'organizational structures and processes; workforce planning, development, and maintenance; information and knowledge systems; and financial resources' [16] (p.13).In addition to recognizing the need for sufficient and appropriate PH staffing, many Ontario documents focused on surge capacity and emergency response to anticipated and unanticipated events [38, 41] .",

        "Considering the current lack of evidence for the superiority of N95 masks, the cost of purchasing large quantities for stockpiling, and the general lack of storage space, it seems unrealistic to prepare for pandemics with N95 masks.",
        "Initial PPE recommendations in these patients included the use of fitted N95 or powered air purifying respirator (PAPR) masks, protective eyewear, gloves, and gowns.However, due to a shortage of N95 masks and increased understanding of droplet and airborne transmissibility during routine care of suspected and positive COVID-19 patients, substitution with a surgical mask with a face shield combination or other protective eyewear during routine non-procedural care has been recommended by the Centers for DiseaseRecommendations related to PPE may continue to change based on supply chain, contingency and/or crisis capacity status.",

        "Federal, state, and local funding sources should invest enough resources in health-care systems to allow EMCC capacity goals to be realized.Planning to expand critical care services to meet the suggested capacity goals requires hospitals to analyze their key medical resources (eg, staff, patient care supplies, and medications) that may be in short supply during a disaster.",

        "Further evaluations of promising novel methods of surveillance utilising technology such as mobile phones or the internet should also be undertaken. Minimum datasets should be designed for use in outbreaks, to ensure more comprehensive data collection that will allow for more rigorous evaluation of the impact of outbreak control measures. Evaluations of prevention and control programs need to be longitudinal rather than crosssectional and report on the impact on disease outcomes, health knowledge and practices, as well as information on the acceptability, cost and sustainability of programs. Education and awareness programs should be designed and evaluated against models of behaviour change to facilitate extrapolation of findings to other contexts. Evaluations of successful prevention and control interventions require replicating in other countries to test the generalisability of findings across different social, cultural and geographic contexts. More evidence is needed from a wider range of countries, in particular resource-constrained settings with less well developed infrastructure. To improve generalisability, more comprehensive descriptions of the community engagement strategies and activities used, and information on the acceptability and uptake of the program by different sectors of the community would be useful. There is a need for translational research to look at how findings from successful interventions can be translated into effective practice. Long term evaluations of established rabies surveillance systems are needed that report both process and outcome measures.",

        "Although formularies designed to constrain pharmaceutical costs limit the use of certain expensive antibiotics, the drive to shorten and prevent both outpatient and inpatient visits encourages the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics to ensure that the patient's infection will be adequately treated.44 Other factors affecting antibiotic choice include presumed efficacy, safety, duration of therapy, and dosing.Thus, review of the clinical aspects of AECB suggests that (1) the etiology of a specific AECB episode is difficult to determine, (2) patients at high risk for treatment failure or early recurrence of AECB can be identified using clinical history, and (3) individualizing treatment decisions in patients with AECB may prove cost-effective.To accurately calculate the total economic burden of AECB, it is necessary to account for all disease-related expenditures over an appropriate time course.",

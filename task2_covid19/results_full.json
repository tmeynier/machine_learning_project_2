        "Utilising this mode of ventilation the patient avoided ECMO and made a full recovery with a viable pregnancy.Airway pressure release ventilation was used as opposed to other ventilatory modes or early ECMO because this lung protective ventilation strategy utilised a pressure controlled mode of ventilation.",
        "Extrapolation to EMCC would require pharmacologically paralyzed patients who remain matched for minute ventilation requirements, dynamic airflow resistance, and compliance throughout the duration of ventilation; however, these parameters are likely to vary during the duration of mechanical ventilation, and may even change over a period of minutes (eg, secretions causing increased airflow obstruction).",

        "In particular, all aspects of a disease or of the epidemiology of the infection will require special attention: clinical manifestation (case definition and pathogenesis of influenza), virulence, mode of transmission, incubation period, period of transmissibility, and its effect on the population (distribution and frequency of the disease).",
        "These, however, are likely underestimates of the true burden of vRTIs as unrecognized infection may lead to other complications such as respiratory, cardiovascular or neurological, hospitalizations, and deaths [1, 3, 4] .As the clinical presentation of vRTIs can be similar, laboratory confirmation is important to determine the pathogen responsible for infection.",
        "(10, 11) Given that hypoxia and electrolyte abnormalities that are common in the acute phase of severe illness can potentiate cardiac arrhythmias, the exact arrhythmic risk related to COVID-19 in patients with less severe illness or those who recover from the acute phase of the severe illness is currently unknown.",

        "These background factors might differ depending on features of the infectious disease, including the mode of transmission (for example, contactbased, respiratory, food-borne or vector-borne), the extent of asymptomatic infection or carriage, and the duration of infection.",
        "However, comorbidities are extremely common in severe cases of MERS-CoV, and documentation of timing of occurrences in the literature is unclear.",
        "Host immune responses, underlying comorbidity, age, and the properties of the infecting pathogen can all contribute to severity.The clinical presentation of many infections, such as infl uenza, is not specifi c, which makes diff erential diagnosis and early treatment to reduce further transmission and severe outcomes diffi cult.",
        "A standard approach of early recognition and isolation of FRI followed by early and aggressive diagnostic testing, treatment, and public health involvement is necessary to protect HCWs, patients, and the community from known and unknown emerging infectious diseases.Unfortunately, the exact etiology for FRI with respiratory failure leading to ARDS is unknown at the time of admission to the ICU."

        "Considering the current lack of evidence for the superiority of N95 masks, the cost of purchasing large quantities for stockpiling, and the general lack of storage space, it seems unrealistic to prepare for pandemics with N95 masks.",
        "Initial PPE recommendations in these patients included the use of fitted N95 or powered air purifying respirator (PAPR) masks, protective eyewear, gloves, and gowns.However, due to a shortage of N95 masks and increased understanding of droplet and airborne transmissibility during routine care of suspected and positive COVID-19 patients, substitution with a surgical mask with a face shield combination or other protective eyewear during routine non-procedural care has been recommended by the Centers for DiseaseRecommendations related to PPE may continue to change based on supply chain, contingency and/or crisis capacity status.",

   "Efforts to determine adjunctive and supportive interventions that can improve the clinical outcomes of infected patients (e.g. steroids, high flow oxygen)":[
      "Although formularies designed to constrain pharmaceutical costs limit the use of certain expensive antibiotics, the drive to shorten and prevent both outpatient and inpatient visits encourages the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics to ensure that the patient's infection will be adequately treated.44 Other factors affecting antibiotic choice include presumed efficacy, safety, duration of therapy, and dosing.Thus, review of the clinical aspects of AECB suggests that (1) the etiology of a specific AECB episode is difficult to determine, (2) patients at high risk for treatment failure or early recurrence of AECB can be identified using clinical history, and (3) individualizing treatment decisions in patients with AECB may prove cost-effective.To accurately calculate the total economic burden of AECB, it is necessary to account for all disease-related expenditures over an appropriate time course.",
      "Specifically, in the circumstance where a patient requires procedural interventions (central venous access, intubation, dialysis, etc) to provide intensive care level support, is the risk posed to providers too high compared to the low potential of benefit, if any, to a patient whose illness may have progressed to a point where such interventions are unlikely to be successful?",
      "\"46 Currently, the standard outcome used in clinical trials of AECB interventions is symptomatic cure of the index exacerbation.Clinical improvement should be the primary outcome of any analysis of AECB therapy; however, since chronic bronchitis is associated with multiple relapses, an evaluation that focuses exclusively on a single exacerbation may be shortsighted.Published trials have concluded that giving patients certain antibiotics may prolong the time period between AECB episodes.47,48 The scientific rationale behind the DFI lies in the level of bacterial eradication achieved by the antibiotic.",
      "Data are emerging, however, that corticosteroid therapy results in moderate improvement in clinical outcomes among patients with AECB.28 However, most of the data on adjunctive treatments for AECB (eg, corticosteroids, bronchodilators) are observational, and the methods used to collect the data are often inconsistent or do not adjust for potential confounding factors.Given the high costs associated with AECB and the theoretical, but unproven, potential for persistent bacterial infection to further deteriorate lung function3 the use of effective antibiotic therapy in the In this study, the antibiotic efficacy results were stratified based on the number of symptoms at baseline (increase in dyspnea, increase in sputum production, and/or change in sputum color).",
      "Because the study is not yet completed, no analysis or definite conclusions can yet be drawn from this trial.Whichever drug is selected, introduction of vasopressors should be considered after optimal fluid loading; these agents may allow therapies to be applied earlier and more aggressively in order to improve physiological parameters and ultimately outcomes [48, 62] .In the initial management of patients with sepsis, improving physiological parameters such as blood pressure and tissue oxygen delivery is a clear goal, as has been emphasized by experts since the late 1990s [63] .",

      "Specialty care and a broader range of laboratory and diagnostic services are more likely to be widely available in hospitals, so traditional hospital inpatient sites should remain the first priority for EMCC until acceptable alternatives are available.Original staffing suggestions for EMCC recommended that non-critical care health-care professionals work in collaborative critical care teams to augment staffing.",

      "However, current disaster medical education programs for healthcare professionals are not coordinated in scope and content, and may not address the most pressing needs for critical care personnel.",
      "Graduated autonomy and extension of attending physicians by senior residents as well as battlefield promotions of fellows and Chief Residents will be the most logical progression as the response to the crisis escalates and personnel are furloughed or quarantined.Unfortunately, in a resource exhaustion and surge capacity, difficult ethical decisions will have to be made on which patients merit the use of a scarce resource.",
      "Whether or not these patients were euthanized, all health care professionals should recognize the danger of having overwhelmed and unsupported staff providing care for dying patients and the potential for incidents like this to undermine public trust in health care professionals.We can look to critical care as a model for providing ''surge'' capacity during a crisis.",
      "The most common occupations are epidemiologist, health scientist, public health advisor, and health communicator; surge staff have experience in nearly 30 different occupational areas.Balancing the need to mobilize large numbers of agency staff, thereby possibly hindering their regular duties, with the need to ensure that existing programs maintain their operations is challenging (19) .",
      "Recognizing the impact of this phenomenon on workforce shortages, the WHO unanimously adopted the WHO Global Code of Practice on the International Recruitment of Medical Personnel in 2010 (88): this Code aims to promote ethical recruitment of health personnel to strengthen health systems and member states are discouraged from active recruitment of health workers from those countries faced with critical shortages of personnel.",

      "The results were consistent, with predictors for the costs of care including age at death, earnings, and CCI scores, of which the coefficients were identical, but the statistical significance was lost because of the small sample size.Our multivariable logistic models showed that the predictors for ICU admission, mechanical ventilation and resuscitation were similar: the odds among patients with ESRD were high, and among those with more comorbidities and those seen by family medicine clinicians the odds were lower.",
      "We defined hospitals as having a high volume of mechanical ventilation if they reported more than 315 mechanical ventilation claims from adult Medicare patients in 2010.",
      "During an ADV type-4 outbreak at Fort Benning in 2000, lack of mechanical ventilation was significantly associated with infection in univariate analysis; however, since no cases slept in areas with operating air handlers, mechanical ventilation could not be included in the multivariate analysis.",
      "Whichever mode of ventilation is used, it is clear that mechanical ventilation may be prolonged.",
      "Utilising this mode of ventilation the patient avoided ECMO and made a full recovery with a viable pregnancy.Airway pressure release ventilation was used as opposed to other ventilatory modes or early ECMO because this lung protective ventilation strategy utilised a pressure controlled mode of ventilation.",

      "Using an N95 mask was unusual: one support worker was observed wearing the mask while working in an isolation ward but did not perform a fit check while putting it on to ensure a proper seal between the respirator's sealing surface and the wearer's face.One major breakdown in compliance was wearing sleeveless disposable plastic aprons instead of long-sleeved gowns during procedures likely to generate splashes or sprays of blood, body fluids, secretions or excretions, and especially when providing perineal care.Lack of compliance was failure to wear goggles or face shields during open suctioning of patients with artificial airways.Participants ensured that single-use items were discarded correctly and placed used articles in appropriate containers or bags, and handled urinals and urine measuring jugs properly.",
